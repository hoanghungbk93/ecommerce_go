# devops-legacy shared templates

This infrastructure is managed by @rewardStyle/devops.

The intent of the templates stored in this directory is to apply only to
legacy infrastructure which was not originally instantiated via CloudFormation.


Any master / root stack designed to take advantage of these templates as
nested stacks will be located in the devops-tools repo in the `/cloudformation`
directory.
